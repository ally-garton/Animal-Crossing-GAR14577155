					<h1>Animal Crossing, Nintendo GameCube, September 2004</h1>
					<p>The original 'Animal Crossing' was released in Japan on 14th April, 2001, for the Nintendo 64 platform. This version of the game was enhanced and re-released for GameCube, which debuted in the UK on 24th September, 2004. The premise of the game revolves around the character moving to a small village inhabited by anthropomorphic animals, and completing activities such as fishing, bug catching, fossil hunting, and house decorating.</p>

					<h1>Animal Crossing: Wild World, Nintendo DS, March 2006</h1>
					<p>The second 'Animal Crossing' game's initial release date in Japan was 23rd November, 2005. The premise remained the same, however the game was enhanced to match the new technology. Players could now utilise an online multiplayer function and visit each others' towns, and players and their houses became more customisable. Players were also given more storage, and additional features were added to the game such as constellation creation and hundreds of new furniture items.</p>

					<h1>Animal Crossing: City Folk, Nintendo Wii, December 2008</h1>
					<p>Released first in North America in November 2008, 'Animal Crossing: City Folk' was the first game ever to utilise Nintendo's 'Wii Speak', an accessory that allowed players to speak to each other while playing online. The gameplay is much like that of 'Wild World', however players are given the option to travel by bus to 'the City' for extra activities such as shopping. Additionally, players had individual houses spread apart from each other, unlike in the previous two games.</p>

					<h1>Animal Crossing: New Leaf, Nintendo 3DS, June 2013</h1>
					<p>After four years and high demand for a new game, 'New Leaf' was released in Japan in November 2012. A new concept was introduced for this game - the player arrives in the town and becomes the new mayor. The player can partake in the same activities as previous games, but the town is now more customisable, with the introduction of 'Public Works Projects'. Furniture, the player's appearance, and the exterior of the player's house also became more customisable with this update.</p>

					<h1>Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer, Nintendo 3DS, October 2015</h1>
					<p>The first 'Animal Crossing' series spin-off, released first in Japan in July 2015, was the first game not to revolve around a human player moving to a new town. Instead, the player works at 'Nook's Homes', where they build, design, and decorate homes based on a character's requests. Many additional furniture and exterior items were added to the game, along with new characters, and the use of amiibo to summon characters of the player's choice into the game.</p>

					<h1>Animal Crossing: Amiibo Festival, Nintendo Wii U, November 2015</h1>
					<p>The second spin-off in the series, released on various dates in November 2015 around the world, was designed to be a virtual board game where the player could choose to play as characters that in the regular games were 'special characters'. The game was poorly received, and its director stated that it was just a way to create 'Animal Crossing' amiibo figures, Nintendo's latest (at the time) endeavour to make various games more interactive.</p>
